# reactTS-MUI5-Template
Custom TSX and MUI5 template. Compiles with Webpack 5 and includes React Router DOM 6 already set up. 

Comes with light and dark theme, as well as with a context for theme switching. There is also a context for notifications, which was added only for fun.

The themes are fully customizable, and have most of the properties you find on the MUI5 documentation. You can expand or simplify them as you see fit.
